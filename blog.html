                            What is keyword research, and why is it important for SEO?

                                Keyword research is the process of finding and analyzing words and phrases that people use when
                                searching for information, products, or services online. It's an essential part of SEO (Search
                                Engine Optimization) as it helps to understand the needs and language of the target audience,
                                and create content that ranks well organically and drives relevant traffic to a website.

                            How can I find relevant keywords for my website?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>
                                Use keyword research tools such as Google Keyword Planner, Moz Keyword Explorer, or SEMrush to
                                find relevant keywords for your website based on search volume, competition, and relevance to
                                your content. Analyze your competitors' keywords, and consider long-tail keywords for specific
                                search intent.

                                No, there is no ideal keyword density for content. Focus on creating high-quality, user-focused
                                content that naturally incorporates relevant keywords, rather than aiming for a specific keyword
                                density. Search engines prioritize user experience and natural language, so avoid keyword
                                stuffing.
